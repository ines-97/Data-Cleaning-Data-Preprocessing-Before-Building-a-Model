# Data-Cleaning-Data-Preprocessing-Before-Building-a-Model
This project contain all the steps for data cleaning before getting into the modeling.
Explore and Preprocess the Data
What to do:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data using plots to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies.
Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and filter out outliers.
Transformation: Normalize or standardize numerical features, encode categorical variables, etc.
Why: Understanding the data helps in selecting appropriate models and preprocessing steps.
