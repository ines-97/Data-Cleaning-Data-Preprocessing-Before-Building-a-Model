This project contain all the steps for data cleaning before getting into the modeling.
# Explore and Preprocess the Data

  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize the data using plots to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies.

- Histograms: Show the distribution of numerical variables.
- Box Plots: Identify outliers and visualize the spread of data.
- Scatter Plots: Examine relationships between two numerical variables.
- Bar Charts: Display frequency counts for categorical variables.
- Correlation Heatmaps: Visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between multiple variables.

**Cleaning:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and filter out outliers.

**Transformation:** Normalize or standardize numerical features, encode categorical variables, etc.
